# This script applies a conditioned latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) algorithm 
# to image created using a Jupyter notebook script (soilSampleLocator.ipynb). 
# Note that the image does not need to be scaled since that is done in the 
# cLHS algorithm The image covers the study area and has the following default bands: 
#   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
#   Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)
#   Continuous Heat-Insolation Load Index (CHILI)
#   Topographic Slope (Slope)
#
# The cLHS algorithm to distributes a user-assigned number of sample points 
# (numSamples) throughout the area. The user also needs to enter the path and 
# file names for the input image file (inImage), output point Shapefile with 
# the sample locations (outShapefile), and study area boundary polygon 
# Shapefile (inBoundaryFile). Itâ€™s important that the projections  of the 
# boundary shapefile and image are the same.

# When the script runs the samples are plotted in the Plots window.
